# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Use the code book and the run_analysis script in this repo to replicate the steps to get a tidy dataset.
